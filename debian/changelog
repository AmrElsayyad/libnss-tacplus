libnss-tacplus (1.0.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Improve debugging on server connections, and always try all
    servers in list until successful response, in case different
    servers have different user databases.

  * Add min_uid and exclude_users config variables to avoid TACACS+
    lookups of local users, for robustness and performance.
